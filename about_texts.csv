Stanford University,https://www.stanford.edu/about,200,"Main Content Who We Are From its founding in California in the late 19th century until today, Stanford has been infused with the American West’s spirit of openness and possibility. We believe strongly in the mission of higher education – to create and share knowledge and to prepare students to be curious, to think critically, and to contribute to the world. With world-class scholars and seven schools located together on a single campus, Stanford offers academic excellence across the broadest array of disciplines. It also is an engine of innovation, blending theory and practice to move ideas and discoveries from labs and classrooms out into the world. We strive to foster a culture of expansive inquiry, fresh thinking, searching discussion, and freedom of thought – preparing students for leadership and engaged citizenship in the world. Excellence in education across disciplines Stanford provides students the opportunity to engage with big ideas, to cross conceptual and disciplinary boundaries, and to become global citizens who embrace diversity of thought and experience. We offer broad and deep academic programs across multiple fields, including the arts and humanities, natural and social sciences, engineering, sustainability, medicine, law, education, and business. The university’s scholarly excellence and culture of innovation uniquely position it to attract the best faculty in the world, who offer students the knowledge and tools to discover and embrace new ideas, and to prepare for successful careers and lives of service. The need for strong ethical principles to achieve a common good is embedded across our educational offerings. Learn more about academics Encouraging open minds and constructive dialogue Discovery and learning require fresh ideas and open discussion. We strive to foster searching discussion, to listen with curiosity, and to ensure the freedom of our university community to study and learn. This includes the freedom to pursue knowledge without constraints; the freedom to challenge orthodoxy, whether old or new; and the freedom to think and speak openly. ePluribus Stanford, a key university-wide initiative, empowers students to think critically and empathetically, engage in meaningful conversations across differences, and embrace active, life-long roles in civic life through whatever field or career path they pursue. Stanford believes that addressing the challenges the world faces requires people from diverse disciplines and backgrounds coming together and deliberating across disagreement. ePluribus Stanford aims to achieve this goal by elevating and amplifying research and education related to free speech, civics, democratic citizenship, and constructive dialogue. Learn more about ePluribus Stanford Interdisciplinary research fueled by innovation A hallmark of Stanford is our extensive and vibrant ecosystem of interdisciplinary research. With all seven of Stanford’s schools located on our historic campus and many institutes serving as a hub for collaboration across academic fields, the opportunities for disruptive breakthroughs are numerous and the results are evident. Our newest school in 70 years, the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, draws on deep interdisciplinary understanding of Earth, climate, and society to create knowledge and scalable sustainability solutions. Stanford’s community of scholars is recognized for accomplishments across a broad range of academic fields. In addition to 36 Nobel Prize winners since the university’s founding – tied among research universities for the most Nobel Prizes won since 2000 – Stanford is also home to numerous recipients of Pulitzer Prizes, National Medals, and MacArthur Fellows .

The protest highlights the huge role of fossil fuel companies, such as Shell, in fueling the climate crisis and the injustice and suffering experienced by vulnerable communities in the Philippines and around the world. Greenpeace is calling on Shell to wake up to the climate emergency, heed the call of communities for justice, and start a rapid and just transition to phase out fossil fuels © Geric Cruz / Greenpeace Legal Unit Jo Dufay Governance Several Greenpeace France activists made an action in front of the Louvre museum to denounce the museum’s complicity with the oil major TotalEnergies. They stood up in front of the Louvre pyramid with banners “Let’s make a law for a world without oil” and “Ban fossil fuel propaganda”. By accepting money from a fossil fuel company with climaticide activity, the Louvre is complicit. As a cultural institution with international influence, the Louvre has a strong social responsibility. It must therefore take up the climate issue! Like all cultural institutions, the Louvre must end any partnership with the fossil industry, which is primarily responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. They also erected an 8-meter-high fake derrick that spewed non-toxic black smoke to symbolize the multinational oil and gas firm’s location within the museum. Further on, 10 activists displayed a banner “Climate: Total criminal, the Louvre accomplice” on the Louvre building. An actor played Patrick Pouyanne (TotalEnergies CEO) as a project manager of this skit. © Joseph Melin / Greenpeace Principles Raising a wind turbine on the beach at dawn in Durban, South Africa.

Human Rights Watch,https://www.hrw.org/about,200,"Would you like to read this page in another language? Yes No, don't ask again ✕ Close Available In English العربية 简体中文 Français Deutsch 日本語 한국어 Português Русский Español About Us Who We Are Human Rights Watch investigates and reports on abuses happening in all corners of the world. We are roughly 500 people of 70-plus nationalities who are country experts, lawyers, journalists, and others who work to protect the most at risk, from vulnerable minorities and civilians in wartime, to refugees and children in need. We direct our advocacy towards governments, armed groups and businesses, pushing them to change or enforce their laws, policies and practices. To ensure our independence, we refuse government funding and carefully review all donations to ensure that they are consistent with our policies, mission, and values. We partner with organizations large and small across the globe to protect embattled activists and to help hold abusers to account and bring justice to victims. What We Do Investigate: Our researchers work in the field in 100 some countries, uncovering facts that create an undeniable record of human rights abuses. Expose: We tell the stories of what we found, sharing them with millions of social media and online followers each day. News media often report on our investigations, furthering our reach. Change: We meet with governments, the United Nations, rebel groups, corporations, and others to see that policy is changed, laws are enforced, and justice is served. We work on some of the world's biggest crises, such as: Russia-Ukraine War Israel-Palestine Taliban Rule in Afghanistan Conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray Region Climate Crisis and Rights Racial Discrimination in the US Our Story Together, we can use our influence – from advocating with world leaders to sharing the truth of what’s happening on the ground – to help stop repression around the world. Ken Roth Former Executive Director Human Rights Watch was founded in 1978 as “Helsinki Watch,” when we began investigating rights abuses in countries that signed the Helsinki Accords, most notably those behind the Iron Curtain. Since then, our work has expanded to five continents. We investigated massacres and even genocides, along with government take-overs of media and the baseless arrests of activists and political opposition figures. At the same time, we expanded our work to address abuses against those likely to face discrimination, including women, LGBT people, and people with disabilities. When families victimized by war crimes found no justice at home, we championed international justice and international courts. While we rely on in-person interviews, our research methods have also changed with the times, and today we use satellite imagery to track the destruction of villages and city blocks, and we mine big data for patterns in arrest rates or the deportation of immigrants. Everything we do circles back to our commitment to justice, dignity, compassion, and equality. Read our full history here How we conduct our research What We Have Achieved When it comes to ending abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice, some victories are big, and others are merely steps on a much longer journey to change. But each represents progress on the many issues we work on around the world. Here are some examples of our impact: Canadian Provinces Abolish Immigration Detention Japan’s Diet Passes Pro-LGBT Law Addressing Racist Policing in Brazil Victory for People with Disabilities in Mexico Congo Warlord Gets 30 Years Protecting Children’s Online Data What can you do?

Construction in 1965 of a new railway line running from Sarajevo to Ploče in Yugoslavia with financial assistance from the World Bank. When the Marshall Plan took over post-war reconstruction efforts in Europe, the World Bank quickly shifted to funding infrastructure projects around the world. Construction of a reservoir in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1973, with World Bank funding, aimed to improve water supply and sewerage services in and around the city. This was the first comprehensive action taken to restore ecological balance in the rivers and part of the Bank’s first loan for environmental projects.

Workers' organizations Employers' organizations Governments Partnerships The ILO partnerships and development cooperation programmes enhance policy coherence and mobilize resources to realize social justice through decent and productive jobs. Development cooperation The ILO and the Multilateral System Reference documents ILO Constitution ILO Constitution ILO Declarations ILO Declarations Managing for results Strategic Plan The Strategic Plan is the ILO's medium-term planning document. It is the expression of the strategic orientation of the Organization, what it aims to achieve and how. It describes the broad goals that are sought by the end of the planning period, sets medium-term priorities as identified by the ILO’s tripartite constituents and provides a framework from within which biennial programme and budget documents are defined and progress is assessed. The ILO’s Strategic Plan for 2026-29 Previous Strategic Plans Programme and Budget The biennial Programme and Budget is proposed by the ILO’s Governing Body to the International Labour Conference and must be adopted through a vote of the Conference. Building from the Strategic Plan, the Programme and Budget establishes both a programme of work and a budget. It specifies the strategies to achieve measurable results, as well as the capacities and the resources required to deliver those results. It also authorizes the relevant regular budget expenditure. The ILO’s biennial programme of work is delivered in Member States mainly through Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs) , aligned with national development plans and UN planning frameworks. The Director-General’s Programme and Budget proposals for 2026–27 Programme and Budget for 2024-25 Previous Programme and Budget documents Sources of funds The results and achievements of the ILO are financed through three main sources of funds: the Regular Budget, funded from assessed contributions by Member States , based on the scale of assessments of the United Nations; the Regular Budget Supplementary Account , funded by voluntary contributions from key partners that provide fully unearmarked core funding to the ILO; and Voluntary contributions from over 140 funding partners, including public and private organizations, IFIs and UN entities, in support of specific development cooperation programmes and projects. The close integration of the different funding sources available to the ILO is central to its strategy to deliver successfully on the social justice mandate of the Organization in countries, regionally and globally. Decent Work Country Programmes Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs) are the ILO’s programming instrument at the country level. They provide a framework that identifies the priorities of the ILO’s constituents in a country and specifies the planned support of the Office to the achievement of results under those priorities. They are developed with full participation of national governments and employers’ and workers’ organizations and are implemented with their active engagement. Country ownership and results orientation are key aspects of DWCPs. DWCPs are aligned with national development priorities and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework . They constitute the ILO’s contribution to the wider UN effort in a country towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. In supporting country priorities identified in DWCPs, ILO programmes build on synergies and complementarity of operations, bringing together diverse sources of funding for the achievement of common outcomes, greater scale and impact. Decent Work Country Programmes Country programme evaluations ILO Development Cooperation Manual Results reports The biennial Programme Implementation report fulfils a governance and accountability function by reporting on the results achieved against the commitments and the targets set in the Programme and Budget for the biennium, within the resources made available. The report also serves to communicate the value of the ILO’s work to a wider audience and contributes to organizational learning as it identifies lessons and actions to further improve performance. The report is only one of the elements of a broader accountability and communication effort, which includes an interactive digital narrative and the ILO Decent Work Results Dashboard. These platforms provide detailed information by outcome, by region and by country with a range of videos, stories and testimonials that illustrate the impact of the ILO’s work on the lives of people and the realization of the ILO’s social justice mandate. ILO programme implementation 2022–23 & Digital Guide Previous ILO programme implementation reports Dashboards: ILO Decent Work Results & ILO Development Cooperation Partnering for Development Risk management The ILO employs a systematic, proactive and continuous process of risk management. Its primary purpose is to enhance the Organization’s preparedness to uncertainties which may affect delivering on its objectives. It also aims at equipping ILO officials with necessary tools and techniques to support risk- informed decision-taking throughout the Organization. Risk management at the ILO Evaluations Evaluation is an accountability, project improvement, and organizational learning tool to help ILO constituents and staff support decent work and social justice.

Their stunning appearance and incredible 3,000 mile migration across the continent have inspired myths and celebrations. Monarch populations are declining. Their numbers are threatened by dwindling native plant populations and climate change, which alters their migration patterns. TNC partners with local communities across the country, including in East Chicago, to protect and celebrate the Monarch.

Wisconsin Oak trees rely on fire to burn away plants that would shade them out. In grasslands, native plants grow and thrive in the aftermath of fires. Controlled burns even decrease severity of wildfires. To help maintain native plant populations, we partner with local organizations and Indigenous leaders to perform safe controlled burns. Plants Thrive With Fire Holmes River Aerial view of the Holmes River, British Columbia, Canada. © Shane Kalyn 5 Reducing Emissions with Nature Technology will take us a long way in reducing carbon emissions, but we must also remove carbon from the atmosphere. Luckily, nature is fantastic at storing carbon, if we give it the chance. Natural solutions, like protecting and managing forests and wetlands, can store 1/3 of the carbon the world needs to avoid climate change's worst impacts.

Today, it’s less likely to refer to the tread mark your sneaker leaves in the dirt, and more to the imprint you’ll leave on the planet. So said New York Times writer William Safire (1929-2009) in a 2008 “On Language” column. In the column, Safire described how the concept of the Ecological Footprint was developed by The University of British Columbia Professor William Rees and Global Footprint Network co-founder Mathis Wackernagel.

Earthwatch Institute,https://earthwatch.org/about,200,"Our Commitment to Sustainability Our Mission & Values Earthwatch connects people with scientists worldwide to conduct environmental research and empowers them with the knowledge they need to conserve the planet. Citizen Science, Community Engagement Since its founding in 1971, Earthwatch has been taking action to address global change through a time-tested model of citizen science and community engagement. By pairing volunteers from all sectors of society with researchers around the world, Earthwatch teams have helped to safeguard critical habitats, conserve biodiversity, and promote the sustainable use of natural resources. The citizen science community is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of inclusive language and its impact on audiences and communities. By moving away from terms like ""citizen"" in favor of alternatives such as ""collaborative science"" or ""participatory science,"" we aim to address the adverse connotations associated with citizenship, which can exclude people who are not legal citizens. This shift in language recognizes the importance of diverse perspectives and broad public participation, regardless of citizenship status. Please see the Citizen Science Association's resource "" Coming to Terms "" for more information. When referring to our own work, Earthwatch prefers the terms ""collaborative science"" and ""participatory science."" As we transition to a more inclusive language, you may still encounter communications in which we refer to earlier work, the practitioner community, or the work of our peers as ""citizen science."" Earthwatch does more than back vital research; it inspires us to understand our global responsibilities as citizens of the world. Dr. E.O. Wilson — American biologist, naturalist, ecologist, and entomologist known for developing the field of sociobiology. Our Focus Areas Engage with People and Communities Earthwatch is a global organization with offices in the U.S., U.K., Australia, India, and Japan. We bring together students, teachers, corporate employees, community members, and the public, in nearly 30 countries around the world. Support Scientific Research We currently support more than 40 research projects globally that produce rigorous, relevant, and impactful science, address global change, and actively involve community participants. Promote Education We’re committed to helping educators and students discover and protect our environment through transformational learning experiences that promote environmentally sustainable action. Partnerships for a Sustainable Planet We work with a wide variety of partners, including corporations, foundations, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions to implement sustainable policies, processes, and practices that promote environmental responsibility both in and out of the office. Our Values At Earthwatch, we believe in the value of creating meaningful connections as a solution to the environmental and social challenges we face. Every person has something to contribute towards a better future. When people feel a sense of belonging, they are equipped with the power to create change towards a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world. Earthwatch supports scientists who produce meaningful research that informs the innovative solutions needed to solve the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. But these scientists can’t do it alone. By connecting them to students, teachers, corporate employees, community leaders, and members of the public, among many other groups, we are opening channels to communicate science far beyond academic circles. Our model provides people with the opportunity to experience scientific research first-hand and empowers them to contribute to solving problems both locally and globally. We acknowledge that science has a history of being exclusive. Building a diverse and equitable environment takes constant work and attention. At Earthwatch, we still have a lot of work to do and are committed to tearing down the barriers that prevent all voices from being heard and present in the field of science. By creating opportunities for research to be accessible to people regardless of their scientific, educational, or social background, we believe we will have a greater impact on creating a more sustainable planet. Our Commitment to Sustainability Earthwatch is dedicated to supporting environmental conservation by connecting people and scientists all over the world. Every year, we engage students, teachers, corporate employees, community leaders, and members of the public in research that informs innovative environmental solutions. Earthwatch mobilizes both local and international volunteers to accomplish this mission. While our research expeditions depend on travel that generates greenhouse gas emissions, this research is critical to understanding and combating climate change and biodiversity threats. Earthwatch has significantly contributed to conservation throughout history, supporting policy plans, protected areas, national parks, and refuges. Expedition members were instrumental in achieving significant victories, such as providing a decade's worth of data to inform Belize's decision to establish the world's first national ray sanctuary in 2018. Reducing Our Carbon Footprint While we believe in the transformative impact of our international projects, Earthwatch is actively working to reduce our carbon footprint. Regional and home-based initiatives have reduced our reliance on international travel over the last decade. This includes virtual programming, corporate partnerships, and community-based participatory programs that empower people with knowledge and tools to take action on climate change and environmental conservation in their communities. Internal actions include transitioning to a remote-first workplace that no longer requires employees to commute to work daily, allowing us to significantly reduce our office space to a ¼ of its previous size. Although we did not make these changes solely due to the climate impacts, they support our goal of operating more sustainably. And while we recognize that these actions do not fully offset our operations' carbon footprint, they are steps in our ongoing commitment to sustainability. Local Initiatives and Youth Empowerment Our research expeditions and programming aim to work with local groups and institutions to identify and implement environmental solutions that address community needs. Operation Healthy Air , our at-home air quality monitoring program, provides the tools and training needed to empower people to mitigate their exposure to poor air quality. Our Global Pollinator Watch, established in 2020, has engaged more than 400 people to collect over 300,000 observations of pollinators and plant species in their communities. Additionally, Earthwatch is empowering future generations of leaders through regional youth programming such as Girls in Science . Since 2016, this program has allowed more than 100 high school students to work alongside leading women scientists while collecting critical environmental data. In 2022, 82% of Girls in Science participants said that the program motivated them to engage in civic or community action to support environmental sustainability. Our Ongoing Dedication to a Sustainable Future We take pride in bringing people and organizations from all over the world together to cultivate a sense of responsibility for our planet and learn about sustainable practices. Earthwatch is adapting and improving its practices to address the global climate crisis, guided by the role of science in environmental issues. As we continue to grow, Earthwatch remains committed to sustainability and making a lasting impact on our shared environment. Fast Facts .

As an independent research organization, we leverage our data, expertise and global reach to influence policy and catalyze change across systems like food, land and water; energy; and cities. Founded in 1982, our 2,000+ staff work on the ground in more than a dozen focus countries and with partners in over 50 nations. Menu About Us Mission & Values Experts & Staff Board of Directors Financials History Our Mission & Values WRI’s mission is to move human society to live in ways that protect Earth’s environment and its capacity to provide for the needs and aspirations of current and future generations. As a world-class research organization, we are driven by our values of impact, integrity, independence, partnership and care. Our Strategic Approach WRI applies a formula to achieve our bold vision. We call it “Count It. Change It. Scale It.”: Count It : Our work is guided by timely, independent research. WRI experts use cutting-edge methods to collect and analyze data, pinpoint problems, assess potential solutions and evaluate real-world outcomes. Our research is subject to rigorous peer reviews to ensure it is both credible and actionable. Change It : We then use our research to inform action on the ground. We start locally, partnering with communities, companies and government agencies to pilot innovative solutions with widespread potential. We help clear barriers to implementation and then monitor progress to learn what works — and what doesn’t. Scale It : Once tested, we strive to expand our successes nationally, regionally and globally. We work with stakeholders ranging from community members to national governments to adapt leading approaches to their needs and mobilize resources. And we make our learnings accessible through partnerships, publications and tools so others can follow suit. Our History WRI was founded by Gus Speth in 1982 in Washington, D.C. with a founding grant of $15 million from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Over time, WRI evolved into a global organization focused on turning research into results. The organization now boasts more than 2,000 staff around the world. Learn more about our history of results over the last 40+ years. Our Advantage WRI brings more than four decades of experience turning evidence into action. Our researchers are trusted experts in their fields. And our commitment to locally led action helps cultivate change that is not only beneficial, but lasting. Our unique approach is built on: World-class research : Timely, independent analysis is WRI’s cornerstone. All our research is peer reviewed and guided by a strategic plan for achieving positive impact. This ensures we assess every potential solution — and choose the right ones for the right places. For example, the State of Climate Action report we publish with partners is the world’s most comprehensive roadmap to close the emissions gap and hold temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Impact-driven data : WRI is at the forefront of using data, technology and AI to drive change. Our Global Forest Watch platform , launched in 2014, was the first open-access portal to track deforestation in near-real time using satellite data. It’s allowed governments, Indigenous groups and others halt illegal deforesters in their tracks. As technology trends shift, we will redouble our use of AI and digital products to accelerate research and enable timely action. Implementation support : We work with stakeholders at all levels to understand and overcome local implementation challenges. Together, we develop tailored solutions that benefit people, nature and the climate simultaneously. In Africa, our Restore Local initiative is providing funding and technical assistance to thousands of landscape restoration projects that will improve livelihoods, boost biodiversity, build climate resilience and reduce emissions. Mighty partnerships : WRI’s independent initiatives bring together governments, businesses, NGOs, civil society and more, forging lasting relationships that can help elevate solutions and raise global ambition. As secretariat of the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy , WRI helped secure commitments from 19 heads of state to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters, collectively covering half the world’s coastlines. Empowering others : We offer individuals, organizations and communities the resources and training needed to scale their impact. Our Partnering for Green Growth (P4G) initiative helps early-stage climate businesses become investment-ready — while also working with national governments and the private sector to develop a stronger market for climate innovation. We measure success by demonstrable change in the world, aligned with international accords like the Paris Agreement and UN Sustainable Development Goals. And we ensure all projects are guided by clear theories of change, designed to be equitable and inclusive, and include methods for tracking progress and learning from results — the key ingredients for maximum impact. A Commitment to Diversity To achieve our global goals, WRI brings together a workforce from diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. As the challenges of racial injustice, inequity, poverty, ecosystem degradation and climate change are inseparable, so, too, are the solutions. We recognize that diversity in all its forms is pivotal to our success. We aspire to foster an atmosphere where everyone feels welcomed and supported. Learn more about our DEI work . Join Us!

Doctors of the World,https://doctorsoftheworld.org/about-us,200,"IN THE FACE OF INJUSTICE, CARE IS SOLIDARITY Doctors of the World USA is a global health and humanitarian organization that delivers medical care—and defends the right to it—in areas where health systems are strained, collapsing, or inaccessible. One of 17 chapters in the Doctors of the World/Médecins du Monde (MdM) international network , we combine global reach with local action. Headquartered in France, and with programs in more than 70 countries, the network brings together healthcare providers and community partners to deliver care where it’s most urgently needed, and defend the right to health for all. OUR STORY Standing with refugees, from the very beginning Doctors of the World was born at sea, after Vietnamese refugees risked everything to escape violence and persecution in the late 1970s. They climbed into overcrowded boats with no guarantee of safety, because survival demanded it. In response, a group of doctors led by Bernard Kouchner, joined by academics and journalists, set sail on a medical ship named Île de Lumière—the “Isle of Light.” Their mission was simple yet profound: to provide urgent medical care and to bear witness to the intolerable. From that first act of solidarity, our international humanitarian network grew. Today, the need is even greater as record numbers of people make dangerous journeys across deserts, jungles, and seas, often facing detention and marginalization when they cross borders. Our mission remains constant: to go where other organizations will not, to provide medical care rooted in dignity, and to confront the forces that push people into danger and harm. OUR FIELD TEAMS At the heart of our work are the providers who deliver care with dignity. Doctors, nurses, midwives, psychologists, community health workers, and other professionals bring care into spaces where others will not or cannot. And they don’t just treat illness. They defend dignity, bear witness to injustice, and remind us that medicine can be a tool of justice as well as healing. United States In El Paso, Texas , we’re training medical residents and students to shape the future of trauma-informed, migrant-centered care at the U.S. Border. Central and South America Doctors and nurses provide care to migrants in transit and to people whose lives have been upended by political unrest, poverty, and drug-trafficking violence in Colombia and Panama . Middle East In Gaza , our teams treat people injured in attacks and monitor rising cases of malnutrition among children and breastfeeding mothers. Their work shows the direct connection between aid blockages and rising malnutrition, underscoring the urgent need for humanitarian access.

World Food Programme,https://www.wfp.org/about,200,"Who we are The World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity, for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change. Overview Mission Funding Partnerships Accountability menu Hunger should not be an issue in today's world In a world of plenty, where enough food is produced to feed everyone on the planet, hunger should be a thing of the past. However, conflict, climate change, displacement, economic shocks and inequality mean 318 million people are acutely hungry and multiple famines are unfolding . Powered by the passion, dedication and professionalism of over 20,000 staff worldwide, the World Food Programme (WFP) has a presence in over 120 countries and territories to carry out its mission. We bring life-saving food to people displaced by conflict and made destitute by disasters, and help individuals and communities find life-changing solutions to the multiple challenges they face in building better futures. We work to enhance nutrition in women and children, support smallholder farmers in improving productivity and reducing losses, help countries and communities prepare for and cope with climate-related shocks, and boost human capital through school feeding programmes. In conflict situations, we bring relief to exhausted populations and use food assistance to build pathways to peace and stability – work for which WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020. Read more about hunger Corporate strategy Governance and leadership Our history We save lives For millions of people worldwide, WFP’s emergency relief during crises is the difference between life and death. On any given day, WFP has 5,000 trucks, 20 ships and about 80 aircraft on the move, delivering emergency assistance, relief and rehabilitation, development aid and special operations to people affected by conflict, droughts, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, crop failures and other disasters. Two-thirds of our work is in conflict-affected countries, where people are three times more likely to be undernourished than those living in countries without conflict. When an emergency subsides, WFP helps rebuild lives and livelihoods by strengthening the resilience of people and communities. We change lives Our work to build resilience, adapt to climate change, promote good nutrition and improve food systems lays the foundations of a more prosperous future for millions. WFP is the largest humanitarian organization implementing school-meal programmes worldwide, with over 50 years’ experience in this area. In 2024, WFP delivered 2.5 million metric tons of food and disbursed US$2.82 billion in cash-based transfers and commodity vouchers – strengthening food and nutrition security and sustaining local economies around the world. We rely on voluntary donations Feeding millions of the world’s hungriest people and helping millions more cope with the effects of conflict, climate change and entrenched poverty requires billions of dollars every year. Our funding requirement for 2026 is US$13 billion to reach 110 million people. Our operations are entirely funded through the generous voluntary contributions of donor governments, institutions, corporations and individuals. A total 93.5 percent of all government contributions go directly to supporting life-saving and life-changing operations . Discover how we are funded We work in partnership WFP works with governments, other United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, private companies and others to mobilize resources, find innovative solutions and reach vulnerable communities with the assistance they need. Our partners We are committed to accountability and transparency WFP holds itself and its staff to the highest standards of integrity and behaviour. We are committed to full transparency and accountability to the people we serve and to the donors who generously fund our operations. We carry out objective and independent audits , as well as investigations and inspections into suspected wrongdoing, misconduct and fraud, as well as sexual exploitation or abuse. To ensure that we remain fit for purpose, we carry out periodic independent evaluations. These provide our donors and partners with greater detail about the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, impact and sustainability of our work.

What is this place all about, exactly? His answer: “The encouragement of research . . . and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell.” Gilman believed that teaching and research go hand in hand—that success in one depends on success in the other—and that a modern university must do both well. He also believed that sharing our knowledge and discoveries would help make the world a better place. Founded in 1876 as the nation’s first research university, Johns Hopkins has been advancing knowledge and bringing discoveries to the world for nearly 150 years. The university’s faculty, clinicians, researchers, and students have pioneered historic discoveries —creating water purification, CPR, corrective surgery for infant heart defects, and a deflection technique to protect Earth from the threat of asteroids. Johns Hopkins has championed lifesaving public health interventions like vitamin A and seat belts, authenticated the Dead Sea Scrolls, and explored the farthest reaches of our solar system. Each year since 1979, Johns Hopkins has been the leading recipient of research funding from the federal government. Those investments fuel lifesaving innovation and interventions, discoveries that enrich our lives and help position the United States at the forefront of the global scientific enterprise. Backed by federal funding, Johns Hopkins researchers have made significant strides in the treatment and understanding of an enormous range of diseases and disorders, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, opioid addiction, and many more. This critical work is made possible by the decades-long compact between the federal government and research institutions like Johns Hopkins, an arrangement of mutual benefit that is the envy of the scientific world. Federal investment supercharges the nation’s innovation ecosystem and returns a substantial economic benefit—fueling innovation, creating and supporting jobs, and facilitating the delivery of new ideas and technologies to industry. In fiscal year 2024, every dollar in federal research investment by the National Institutes of Health generated approximately $2.56 in economic activity. Johns Hopkins is the largest private employer in Baltimore and Maryland and has broad economic, social, and cultural ties to its hometown. Johns Hopkins University & Health System has an estimated $19.4 billion economic impact in Baltimore and an estimated $40 billion economic impact in Maryland.

Global Citizen About Us Our Issues Our Impact Governance Our Partners Campaigns Convening Awards Collaborations Events Take Action Rewards Download the App Partner With Us Shop Donate Download App About Us We envision a world free from extreme poverty. NOW. We are an advocacy platform dedicated to achieving the end of extreme poverty, powered by a community of millions of Global Citizens who believe in one world, one people - where everyone has an equal chance to thrive. This is our world and the actions of one can have a profound impact on many. That's why we rally around the critical issues of climate change, poverty, and inequality. This is our generation’s moment. It’s in our hands. What Are Global Citizens? At its core, being a Global Citizen means believing that extreme poverty can be eliminated, and that the resources to end it can be mobilized if enough people take action. It means learning about the systemic inequalities that fuel poverty — racial, ethnic, gender, sexual, and economic inequalities — and joining us in taking action to overcome these in a way that’s sustainable. Most importantly, it means realizing that when we use our voices together, we are powerful and we can ensure lasting change in the mission to defeat poverty and defend the planet. Global Citizens recognize the power of advocacy, of shining a light on overlooked issues to rally people worldwide and mobilize ongoing support from those that can drive real change — governments, the private sector, philanthropists, and everyday citizens. Learn More How Do We Create Change? The Global Citizen platform mobilizes millions of people and convenes across sectors — business, entertainment, policy, government, philanthropy — to drive tangible policy change and financial investments to defeat poverty and defend the planet. Our advocacy platform encompasses a broad range of impactful activities, such as: Campaigns: Global Citizen is a platform that millions of people around the world use to help achieve the end of extreme poverty. Convening Convening: We convene leaders across sectors to address the world's challenges through discussion and impactful action. Awards: We award and support world-changing advocates and social entrepreneurs to amplify and scale their work to end extreme poverty. Collaborations: We collaborate with world-leading artists, brands and organisations to create new ways to learn and take action to end extreme poverty. Events & Broadcasts: We leverage the power of bringing together leaders in pop culture and policy to drive progress towards our mission. Our History Originally founded as the Global Poverty Project in 2008 by Hugh Evans, Simon Moss, and Wei Soo, Global Citizen was co-founded as a platform with Michael Sheldrick and Ryan Gall in 2012. The organisation is now headquartered in New York, with offices in Canada, South Africa, Nigeria, Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with a leadership team based around the world, ensuring we continue to deliver our misson.

World Trade Organization,https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/wto_dg_stat_e.htm,200,"WTO | What is the WTO? - About the WTO  A statement by former Director-General Pascal Lamy home the wto what is the wto? overview Overview The World Trade Organization  the WTO  is the international organization whose primary purpose is to open trade for the benefit of all. See also: > About the WTO  Understanding the WTO > The WTO in Brief The WTO provides a forum for negotiating agreements aimed at reducing obstacles to international trade and ensuring a level playing field for all, thus contributing to economic growth and development. The WTO also provides a legal and institutional framework for the implementation and monitoring of these agreements, as well as for settling disputes arising from their interpretation and application. The current body of trade agreements comprising the WTO consists of 16 different multilateral agreements (to which all WTO members are parties) and two different plurilateral agreements (to which only some WTO members are parties). Over the past 60 years, the WTO, which was established in 1995, and its predecessor organization the GATT have helped to create a strong and prosperous international trading system, thereby contributing to unprecedented global economic growth. The WTO currently has members, of which 117 are developing countries or separate customs territories. WTO activities are supported by a Secretariat of some 700 staff, led by the WTO Director-General. The Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and has an annual budget of approximately CHF 200 million. The three official languages of the WTO are English, French and Spanish. Decisions in the WTO are generally taken by consensus of the entire membership. The highest institutional body is the Ministerial Conference , which meets roughly every two years. A General Council conducts the organization's business in the intervals between Ministerial Conferences. Both of these bodies comprise all members. Specialised subsidiary bodies (Councils, Committees, Sub-committees), also comprising all members, administer and monitor the implementation by members of the various WTO agreements. More specifically, the WTO's main activities are:  negotiating the reduction or elimination of obstacles to trade (import tariffs, other barriers to trade) and agreeing on rules governing the conduct of international trade (e.g. antidumping, subsidies, product standards, etc.)  administering and monitoring the application of the WTO's agreed rules for trade in goods, trade in services, and trade-related intellectual property rights  monitoring and reviewing the trade policies of our members, as well as ensuring transparency of regional and bilateral trade agreements  settling disputes among our members regarding the interpretation and application of the agreements  building capacity of developing country government officials in international trade matters  assisting the process of accession of some 30 countries who are not yet members of the organization  conducting economic research and collecting and disseminating trade data in support of the WTO's other main activities  explaining to and educating the public about the WTO, its mission and its activities. The WTO's founding and guiding principles remain the pursuit of open borders, the guarantee of most-favoured-nation principle and non-discriminatory treatment by and among members, and a commitment to transparency in the conduct of its activities. The opening of national markets to international trade, with justifiable exceptions or with adequate flexibilities, will encourage and contribute to sustainable development, raise people's welfare, reduce poverty, and foster peace and stability. At the same time, such market opening must be accompanied by sound domestic and international policies that contribute to economic growth and development according to each member's needs and aspirations.",3900

Skip to contents Contents Our history What we stand for How we're funded Working here Contact us More about Wellcome Our history We were founded in 1936 after the death of Sir Henry Wellcome, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur, with a pioneering approach to drug design. In his will, he left us three important things: his wealth; his collection of historical medical items; and our mission to improve health through research. Since our formation, we have supported breakthroughs in scientific discoveries and advocated for policies to improve health for everyone. Today, Wellcome supports science to solve the urgent health challenges facing everyone. We have four programmes of work: one for discovery research, and three to find solutions for the challenges of mental health, climate and health, and infectious diseases. Explore the timeline giving you a snapshot of key achievements since 1936 1936 Wellcome Trust was founded after the death of Sir Henry Wellcome. 1938 First grants were made by the Wellcome Trust to support Henry Wellcome’s mission for the Trust, to improve health through research. 1955 Wellcome established the Wellcome Research Travel Grants scheme, the first funding in the UK for university researchers to make short visits to other laboratories around the world. 1957 Wellcome provided £100,000 to build Wellcome Institute for Research on Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Cattle in Nairobi, Kenya. 1967 Wellcome trustees adopted a more proactive funding policy. As well as responsive-mode grants, they looked for opportunities to fill gaps and create opportunities to advance research. 1979 To support research in Thailand and Laos, Wellcome established the Wellcome Trust-Mahidol University-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme in partnership with the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University . 1989 The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme was established in partnership with the Kenya Medical Research Institute . 1990 Wellcome joined the Human Genome Project , the largest international collaboration ever undertaken in biology. Over 13 years, thousands of scientists around the world sequenced the 3 billion pieces of genetic information in every human cell (except red blood cells). Learn more 1991 Wellcome supported the creation of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) , a large-scale clinical and public health research unit with site offices in Vietnam, Indonesia and Nepal. 1992 The Wellcome Sanger Institute was established to complete one-sixth of the total sequencing for one of the most ambitious projects ever attempted in biology: sequencing the human genome. 1995 The Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme was established to use science to drive health and wellbeing in Malawi. 2003 Nearly a third of the Human Genome Project was sequenced at the Wellcome Sanger Institute . New knowledge and tools stemming from the project are now transforming healthcare, such as through better diagnosis of rare genetic disorders. 2007 Wellcome Collection, our museum and library, opened in London, UK. Learn more 2010 Wellcome signed an agreement between the Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK and University College London to found The Francis Crick Institute which would go on to become the largest biomedical research institute in Europe. 2014 In response to the biggest ever outbreak of Ebola virus, Wellcome led a fast, coordinated programme of research. These efforts contributed to the first Ebola vaccine being licensed and approved in 2019. Learn more 2017 Wellcome was a founding member of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) , which funded nine Covid-19 vaccines. 2020 Wellcome Leap was established with a $250mn investment from Wellcome, to support scientists, technologists and innovators from around the world to pursue bold ideas that would fall outside the remit of conventional life sciences funding.

Climate Central,https://www.climatecentral.org/about,200,"About us Our mission Climate Central communicates climate change science, effects, and solutions to the public and decision-makers. Who we are Climate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people’s lives. We are a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Climate Central uses science, big data, and technology to generate thousands of local storylines and compelling visuals that make climate change personal and show what can be done about it. We address climate science, sea level rise, extreme weather, energy, and related topics. We collaborate widely with TV meteorologists, journalists, and other respected voices to reach audiences across diverse geographies and beliefs. Our impact Climate Central's best-in-class global elevation data anchored visualizations and maps used at the 2021 UN Climate Conference to illustrate sea level rise projections. To date, our online maps and tools have been used more than 10 million times. Our 10-year-old Climate Matters program provides production-ready graphics and climate science reporting resources to meteorologists and journalists in 95% of U.S. media markets. Along with a small team of international experts, our scientists launched the groundbreaking World Weather Attribution, changing the narrative on links between climate change and individual extreme weather events. Our pioneering attribution work continues with the Climate Shift Index, which along with our other tools and data analyses support communication, planning and adaptation initiatives around the world. 50,000+ mentions Articles, stories, and segments using Climate Central content to communicate climate change impacts and solutions reach local audiences nearly every day 170+ countries Audiences in nearly every country have seen Climate Central maps and visualizations, and read or heard commentary from our scientists What sets us apart Climate Central is the only climate communications group that produces and disseminates localized and visual content weekly and at national scale; co-houses scientists, journalists, and technologists; and conducts and catalyzes original, peer-reviewed scientific research to fill critical communication gaps. We have built strong relationships with thousands of trusted, mostly local messengers who deliver our content. Local relevance and credibility make our communications effective; the broad scale of our efforts help advance national and global conversations. Our approach For decades, scientists have warned that our planet is facing a climate emergency that could alter life on earth for the foreseeable future, and they have called for urgent action to match the gravity of the threat. Today, there is mounting evidence that the adverse impacts of climate change are growing more frequent and severe—forcing millions of people around the world to grapple with serious consequences, year after year. Our vision and strategy At Climate Central, we envision a world where public will to address the climate challenge is robustly deep, broad, and sustained—where it becomes a core element of culture everywhere. No generation in human history has carried a greater burden nor shared a greater opportunity to shape the future for the better. And we know what is at stake. To help address this existential threat, Climate Central’s mission is to make accurate and effective climate communication ubiquitous. We employ a range of research-based communication strategies: We generate tailored local content that makes information about climate impacts and solutions immediate, accessible, and personal. We do it widely. We do it frequently. We make it visual. And to reach diverse audiences effectively, we systematically deliver this content via trusted voices and pathways. We aim to make climate a top priority issue for citizens and decision-makers at every level in private and public sectors alike. More specifically, we use science, big data, and technology to generate thousands of local storylines and compelling visual images that make clear the impacts of climate change, the unequal burdens they pose, and what can be done about it all. To disseminate this vital information at national and global scales, we work with a large and growing network of meteorologists and journalists, as well as many other trusted voices—from government and business leaders to planners, nongovernmental organizations, and educators. Climate Central’s research, maps, tools, and visualizations help millions of people around the world to understand the climate threats facing their communities, the most vulnerable among us, and all of humanity—and what we can all do about them. Evaluations have found that our methods increase ideologically broad acceptance of climate science and concern about climate change consequences. Climate Central is policy- and technology-neutral. We cherish our record of scientific and journalistic integrity, effective communication, and collaboration. Our values Policy Neutrality — We advance no specific policy, legislation, or technology to address climate change. We are scrupulously non-advocacy and non-partisan. Scientific and Editorial Integrity — We communicate the facts of climate change wherever they lead. Importance of Informing the Public — We seek to reach broad audiences with scientific facts to support informed public discussion and democratic decision-making. Effective Communication — We use an innovative mix of science and communication, scaled by technology, which defines our approach to reach and move important audiences. Revealing Consequences — We are committed to investigating and communicating the disproportionate impacts of climate change, and to engaging with affected communities. Collaboration — We contribute our talents and efforts alongside many other organizations working to address the great challenge of climate change. Inclusion Climate change disproportionately impacts some communities. Groups that have barely contributed to the problem often face its gravest threats and impacts and may have the fewest resources to prepare, respond, or recover. Climate Central regularly highlights the consequences of climate change and tells the stories of the many different groups affected by it. We reaffirm our commitment to investigate and publicize the disproportionate impacts of climate change, and to increase our efforts in this area. We also reaffirm our commitment to engage with affected communities in developing and disseminating our materials, and to increase our efforts to feature experts who can speak to the needs and experiences of affected groups. See Examples Our history In 2008, motivated by climate scientists’ high levels of concern about the heating planet versus the low priority given by the public and decision-makers, a group of leading scientists, philanthropists and communicators established Climate Central. They aimed to bridge that gap and promote understanding and action in line with the threat. To do it, they built an organization designed to communicate the facts about climate change and its solutions accurately, widely, and effectively. Over the years, Climate Central has grown from working with just a handful of news organizations to collaborating with hundreds and making a mark on thousands. We have evolved from creating a small number of fully produced stories to providing science-based content, tools, and training that support countless storytellers and stakeholders in media, social media, government, businesses, NGOs, and beyond. We moved from tapping only existing climate science to filling key gaps and making headlines with our own research. We have developed an advanced technology capacity to generate and disseminate tailored, local climate information at national and global scale, with high-quality graphics–all available, for free. And we have expanded from a U.S. focus at the start to embracing global initiatives today. Climate Central took its original shape with seed funding from the Flora Family Foundation and development funds from the 11th Hour Project . The founding board members were Jane Lubchenco , Stephen W. Pacala , and Wendy Schmidt . Climate Central has developed several high-impact major initiatives. We created Climate Matters to bring climate change into weathercasts via local voices highly trusted by Americans everywhere: TV meteorologists. In the program’s first year, we placed our content in about 50 segments; in its tenth, that number exceeded 5,000. Climate Central’s research, tools, and visuals on sea level rise have repeatedly achieved widespread global distribution and are used by millions. And Climate Central’s work developing and communicating the rapid scientific attribution of extreme weather events to climate change has accelerated a critical shift in the narrative. You can legitimately quantify the link between many individual events and climate change, and the media, leaders, and the public increasingly recognize this. Timeline 2008 Climate Central is founded. First television segment aired on PBS NewsHour. 2009 Began research on sea level rise. 2010 Piloted an initiative to bring climate change to TV weather. 2012 Launched Climate Matters and spurred 55 TV segments, aired by a dozen participating TV meteorologists. Made national headlines with sea level rise program research and maps. Invited to and testified in a Senate committee hearing. 2014 Led the creation of World Weather Attribution , in order to put a number on the influence of climate change on select individual extreme weather events; do it fast enough to bring results into the news cycle; and eliminate the false public narrative that individual events could not be tied to warming. 2015 Co-authored the first-ever rapid extreme weather attribution analysis. Ahead of Paris climate talks, published sea level research and visuals reaching 5,000 news stories. Driven substantially by concerns about sea level rise, the global Paris Agreement included a more ambitious stretch goal than expected: limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees C. 2016 The U.S. National Academy of Sciences validated attribution of extreme weather events to climate change in a report . Media narratives increasingly recognized climate links to extreme events. 2017 Completed 10th rapid extreme event attribution project. 2018 Launched WeatherPower , bringing solar and wind power generation into the daily local forecast. More than 1,000 TV segments included Climate Matters content. Climate Matters expanded beyond the TV weatherdesk to all beats and all media. 2019 Launched Partnership Journalism program , collaborating with local newsrooms nationwide to produce in-depth science-backed stories. 2019 Rewrote understanding of global sea level threats with publication of a new AI-supported assessment . Generated more media and online attention than any other peer-reviewed climate research paper from at least 2011-2021 (sources: Altmetric, Carbon Brief). More than 1 million users explored Climate Central’s associated online mapping tool . 2020 More than 1,000 TV meteorologists participating in Climate Matters–plus 800 other journalists. 2021 More than 5,000 TV segments included Climate Matters content. Climate Matters named an international Landmark initiative by Tools of Change. Launched Realtime Climate , a system for rapidly dispatching tailored local climate content and alerts to subscribers when local conditions warrant. 4,000 media outlets worldwide covered Picturing Our Future , Climate Central’s research and visuals that show contrasting futures under different pollution and heating scenarios—released three weeks ahead of major global climate talks in Glasgow. 2022 Climate Central began working with The Weather Company, an IBM Business , to make our climate-related content available to a larger audience via TWC’s hundreds of media product clients. Launched the Climate Shift Index , the world’s first service for daily local temperature attribution—putting a number on the influence of climate change on observations and forecasts.",12163

Ocean Conservancy,https://oceanconservancy.org/about,200,"Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Story Our ocean is truly awesome But it is not invincible. Our ocean supports all life on our blue planet. It produces half of the world’s oxygen and absorbs 90% of the excess heat from climate change. It provides habitats and ecosystems for millions of unique species. It is directly responsible for the prosperity and quality of life of people around the world. We depend on our ocean for so much, and year over year, we demand more and more. From plastic pollution to overfishing and offshore oil drilling, human action is stressing our ocean and threatening its ability to sustain life as we know it. Our ocean is calling out for help.

IBM Research,https://research.ibm.com/about,200,"Inventing What’s Next In Computing We are a community of scientists, engineers, and designers creating the next advances in computing technology. It’s impossible to tell the story of computing without IBM. Our mission at IBM Research has always been to invent what’s next in computing. It’s why IBM researchers have authored more than 110,000 publications 110,000 publications . It’s why they are regularly featured in the world’s most prestigious journals and conferences conferences , and it’s why their awards include six Nobel Prizes, ten Medals of Technology, five National Medals of Science, and six Turing Awards. Today, IBM Research stands at the forefront of computing. Our semiconductor research semiconductor research is pushing the limits of scaling and redefining the way chips are designed; we’re creating new foundation models foundation models and hardware for the next generation of enterprise AI; we’re a world leader in quantum computing quantum computing ; and we’re envisioning a multi-cloud platform multi-cloud platform where diverse computing environments function as one. This is the era of bits, neurons, and qubits. Bits To continue scaling computing power, the next generation of chips will require new approaches. That’s why IBM Researchers are designing new transistors and new chip architectures to meet tomorrow's demands for power, efficiency, and security. Neurons AI and machine learning have become critical for business, but industry-leading models can be costly to develop, and opaque. At IBM Research we’re inventing powerful and trustworthy foundation models and tools for enterprise tasks, so that businesses can create AI solutions of their own. Qubits Quantum computing is expected to solve complex problems that are out of reach for even the most powerful classical computers. The challenge is how to scale quantum systems, make them more reliable, and make them easier to integrate with other computing architectures. This is our mission – to bring useful quantum computing to the world. Multi-cloud: a universal control plane Classical computing is essential for integrating computing systems and solving well-understood problems at scale. AI is well-suited for problems where the relationships in the data are unknown and need to be learned. Quantum computing aims to tackle difficult problems where the search space is too vast for classical computers to explore efficiently. Choosing the right approach for a given task is key to harnessing their power. But our vision takes this a step further. We see a future of dynamic composability, where specialized computing technologies can be orchestrated and optimized, as part of a unified system. In this future, bits, neurons, and qubits work together, seamlessly. This convergence of computing modalities will enable the next generation of intelligent systems, accelerating the rate we solve complex problems–for science, for business, and for society. A new era of computing has begun, and IBM Research is helping to shape it.

Here’s our story: Mike and Scott, both 18, land in the same scholarship course at the University of New South Wales. 1998 Atlassian, inspired by the Greek Titan, is registered as a business name. 2001 Atlassian becomes real with the launch of Jira 1.0. 2002 Confluence 1.0 is born and released to the world. 2003 1,000 We get our 1,000th customer. 2005 We co-found Pledge 1% and Atlassian Foundation is created. 2006 Our five core values come to life.

Tackling a global challenge Around three billion people worldwide don’t have access to care. Many patients still suffer from diseases, which could already be treated successfully, simply because means of diagnoses and therapies are not yet affordable or accessible to them. We believe everyone should have access to high-quality and individualized care. The reality is healthcare systems worldwide are facing a multitude of challenges: from limited funding, to shortage of qualified staff, to geographical barriers and limitation in local infrastructure, combined with aging population, the raising burden of chronic diseases, and increasing frequency of emergency disruptions accelerated by climate change. Learn how we want to bring access to care to everyone, everywhere Global business, local care Even the most advanced technology is only as good as the number of people who have access to it. That's why innovation must be followed by scalability. This means solutions that can be tailored to the needs of our customers, the healthcare providers, and the local infrastructures, in which they are integrated. What all healthcare systems have in common is their demand for high-value care – providing better outcomes with fewer resources. And while medtech is a global business, healthcare is inherently local. We are currently present in more than 70 countries around the globe, making sure we are close to our customers. Our products, solutions, and services are customized to meet local market needs, benefiting from an unmatched global expertise.

Explore the milestones along our journey. 1800s 1900s 1910s 1920s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020-2021 2022 1849 Cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart founded Charles Pfizer & Company in a red brick building in Brooklyn, NY. 1868 Pfizer buys and renovates a post-Revolutionary-era building at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan and moves its headquarters there. The expansion propelled by the Civil War continues and Pfizer's revenues double. Expand to see more The company now has a substantially increased product line and 150 new employees. To accommodate this growth, it buys and renovates a post-Revolutionary-era building at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan and moves its headquarters there. The site carries the Pfizer name for nearly a century. Collapse 1882 Spurred by America's westward expansion and its own growing number of clients west of the Mississippi, Pfizer opens offices and a warehouse in Chicago, Illinois, its first location outside of New York. 1900 Pfizer files an official certificate of incorporation in the state of New Jersey, with authorized capital of $2 million divided into 20,000 shares of $100 each. Expand to see more Pfizer would remain a privately held company until June 22, 1942, when 240,000 shares of new common stock were offered to the public. Collapse 1905 Emile Pfizer was the last member of the Pfizer/Erhart family to be actively involved with the company. He was president from 1906 to 1941. Expand to see more Emile Pfizer, Charles Pfizer's youngest son, is appointed President at a special board meeting. He serves as President from 1906 to 1941 and briefly as Chairman in 1941. He is the last member of the Pfizer/Erhart family to be actively involved with the company. Collapse 1906 At the age of 82, Charles Pfizer dies while vacationing at his Newport, Rhode Island estate. A tribute to Pfizer in The New York Tribune notes that ""by bringing to his task a thorough German technical education, great industry, and determination, he successfully met all difficulties and each year expanded his business."" Company sales exceed $3 million. 1914 John Anderson, starting at Pfizer in 1873 as an office boy, opened the company's first branch in Chicago within ten years. Later he served as Chairman of the Board, 1914-1929. The Board of Directors creates the position of Chairman and elects John Anderson to that post. Anderson, who had joined Pfizer in 1873 as a 16-year-old office boy, would remain Chairman until 1929. 1919 Pfizer chemist James Currie and his assistant, Jasper Kane, successfully pioneer the mass production of citric acid from sugar through mold fermentation—an achievement that eventually frees Pfizer from dependency on European citrus growers. Expand to see more Spurred by this invention, Kane goes on to develop a new deep-tank fermentation method using molasses rather than refined sugar as raw material—the process that will ultimately unlock the secret for large-scale production of penicillin. Collapse 1924 Charles Pfizer & Co. turns 75 years old. A celebration at the Brooklyn plant, which has 306 employees, marks the milestone. 1929 William H. Erhart, son of Charles Erhart, one of the two original founders. He became vice president of the company in 1900 and served as Chairman of the Board from 1929 to 1940. Expand to see more On January 10, 1929, John Anderson announces he is stepping down as chairman of the board. William Erhart is named the new chairman, Emile Pfizer continues to serve as president, and John Anderson's son, George, becomes senior vice president. Collapse 1936 Doctor Richard Pasternack develops a fermentation-free method for producing ascorbic acid, vitamin C. After building a new plant and initiating a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week production schedule, Pfizer becomes the world's leading producer of vitamin C. Expand to see more Encouraged by this success, Pfizer pushes ahead in 1938 with production of vitamin B-2, or riboflavin, and eventually develops a vitamin mix that includes riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and iron. From vitamin B-12, the company moves on to vitamin A, and by the late 1940s, Pfizer will become the established leader in the manufacture of vitamins. Collapse 1939 Pfizer succeeds so well in the production of citric acid by fermenting sugar that a pound of citric acid, which had cost $1.25 in 1919, tumbles to 20¢, and Pfizer is widely recognized as a leader in fermentation technology. 1941 Pfizer responds to an appeal from the United States Government to expedite the manufacture of penicillin to treat Allied soldiers fighting in World War II. Of the companies pursuing mass production of penicillin, Pfizer alone uses fermentation technology. Expand to see more In a risky maneuver, Pfizer's senior management invests millions of dollars, putting their own assets as Pfizer stockholders at stake, to buy the equipment and facilities needed for this novel process of deep-tank fermentation. Pfizer purchases a nearby vacant ice plant, and employees work around the clock to convert it and perfect the complex production process. In just four months, Pfizer is producing five times more penicillin than originally anticipated. Penicillin is a turning point in human history—the first real defense against bacterial infection. Collapse 1944 Pfizer is successful in its efforts to mass-produce penicillin and becomes the world's largest producer of the ""miracle drug."" Using deep-tank fermentation, Pfizer is successful in its efforts to mass-produce penicillin and becomes the world's largest producer of the ""miracle drug.""

Pfizer begins expansion into overseas markets and the International Division is created. Expand to see more Terramycin also marks the beginning of the Pfizer Pharmaceutical Sales Force. Upon its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration on March 15, 1950, eight specially trained Pfizer pharmaceutical salesmen waiting for word at pay phones across the nation move into action to get inventory to wholesalers and to educate physicians about Pfizer's first proprietary pharmaceutical product. These men are the vanguard of a sales and marketing organization that will come to be recognized as the best in the industry. Collapse 1951 In a major international expansion, Pfizer operations are established in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, England, Mexico, Panama, and Puerto Rico. John ""Jack"" Powers, Jr., then assistant to Pfizer President John McKeen, directs his international teams to “study the economy, establish proper contacts with government officials, learn the language, history, and customs, and hire local employees wherever possible."" Expand to see more While other companies keep their international employees on a short leash, Pfizer gives its international people tremendous autonomy, enabling them to make critical decisions immediately, rather than waiting weeks, or even months, for the home office to respond. This formula proves to be remarkably successful in the years ahead. Collapse 1952 Pfizer establishes an Agricultural Division dedicated to offering cutting-edge solutions to animal health problems. The division opens its 700-acre farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana. 1953 After it's acquisition, J.B.

Learn more about the Asian Development Bank Your Story, Your Generation Whether in the fight against climate change, promoting trade and economic integration, or building an inclusive future for the young, women and the elderly, it is the resilience of generations from Asia and the Pacific that will determine our success. Educating Cambodia’s Young Cambodia’s young like 12-year-old Morb Kanha can be a force for development when provided with the education and opportunities they need to improve their lives. Asia and the Pacific has significantly increased access to education and achieved relevant targets under the Millennium Development Goals, although challenges remain. ADB works across Asia and the Pacific to promote quality, accessible education for all in support of sustainable development. Georgia’s Trading Gold In 2019, Baaka Babunashvili, 28 years old, and his childhood friend Nika Sioridze, 30 years old, rehabilitated 25 hectares of tea plantations in Georgia, joining a movement that is reviving an industry that was all but lost in the country. Georgia’s strategic location makes it a natural logistics and transit hub along the “new Silk Road,” linking trade between Asia and Europe. ADB believes cross-border trade and regional cooperation are key to achieving economic growth and narrowing development gaps. Papua New Guinea’s Beekeeping Queen For 53-year-old Hepsibah Kole, beekeeping not only allows her to earn money and pay for her children’s schooling, it also helps her fulfil her aspiration of being independent and make her own decisions.

ADB is working to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, and reduce poverty and contribute to a green, equitable, and inclusive development. Bangladesh’s Water Crops Farmers in the south-central districts of Bangladesh, like Firdouz Ahmed, 62, are turning to a centuries-old form of hydroponics to grow their crops in rising waters to adapt to changing climate. ADB is scaling up nature-based solutions and climate-smart agriculture support. In the face of rapidly growing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing impact from climate change and disasters, and ongoing environmental damage, ADB has placed combating climate change and its consequences at the top of its development agenda. Indonesia’s Golden Generation Eighty-three-year-old Engkom Komariah runs a small business in Indonesia’s West Java where she employs elderly women so they can be financially independent. Rapid aging in Asia and the Pacific has put the region at the forefront of one of the most important global demographic trends that is set to have wide social and economic consequences. Recognizing the contributions of the older generation, ADB pays special attention to the long-term care and health of the region’s aging population through its growing health and social protection projects.

Our vision is a world where all are free. Our mission is to expand and defend freedom globally. Freedom House was founded in 1941 to rally policymakers and a broadly isolationist American public around the fight against Nazi Germany, and to raise awareness of the fascist threat to American security and values. In the decades since, Freedom House has established itself through its advocacy, programs, and research as the leading American organization devoted to the support and defense of democracy around the world. We work across political divides to advance policies that strengthen democracy and protect human rights. We support a vast, trusted network of activists and advocates who are leading the struggle for democratic change in their countries. When these courageous individuals are attacked for their activism, journalism, or opposition to tyranny, we strive to keep them safe so that they may continue their important work. Our History: Founded in 1941 to Defend Democracy Worldwide Since its founding, Freedom House has monitored the state of freedom and democracy around the world, and helped shaped the debate on the most pressing issues of our time. Learn More We inform the world about threats to freedom. For more than 50 years, Freedom House has systematically tracked the most pressing threats to democracy and freedom around the globe. We publish detailed research on more than 200 countries and territories , because accurate data and rigorous analysis are essential to shining a light on the erosion of freedom. Policymakers, activists, and civil society groups rely on our research for guidance as they work toward a more open, just, and free world. Business leaders turn to Freedom House to help ensure that their actions support—rather than undermine—democracy. From detailed assessments on political rights and civil liberties ( Freedom in the World ) and the definitive study on internet freedom ( Freedom on the Net ) to groundbreaking new research on the tactics used by authoritarians to silence their critics or expand their influence abroad (Transnational Repression), our analysis provides essential insights into the state of freedom and democracy around the world. We mobilize policymakers, advocates, and leaders to act. Freedom House’s analysis of the state of global democracy and extensive work with front-line activists gives us unique credibility to advocate for policies that would reinforce democratic governance in the United States and around the world. We work closely with policymakers to protect human rights and to vigorously oppose dictatorship and oppression. We enable political dissidents and rights defenders to tell their stories to the US Congress and executive branch, the news media, and the United Nations, ensuring that first-hand information reaches decision makers. And we form partnerships with peer groups to galvanize support for democracy in all countries. To learn more about Freedom House’s policy positions and advocacy work, visit our Policy Recommendations page . We support democracy advocates and human rights defenders. Freedom House advances the efforts of people around the world to live in freedom and exercise their rights. We do this, even in the most politically restrictive settings , by building long-term relationships with local activists as they promote open government, defend human rights, strengthen civil society, and facilitate the free flow of information and ideas. Since 2007, we have assisted tens of thousands of activists, victims of human rights abuses, and their families across 150 countries by providing support for urgent needs like relocation, legal representation, trial monitoring, technical equipment, medical and living expenses, and other life-saving services. We enhance their ability to fight corruption, document and promote accountability for human rights abuses, and demand equal rights, especially for at-risk communities. We also conduct targeted campaigns for the release of imprisoned activists so that they can continue their work, often in exile, and help bring democratic change to their countries.

As an independent research organization, we leverage our data, expertise and global reach to influence policy and catalyze change across systems like food, land and water; energy; and cities. Founded in 1982, our 2,000+ staff work on the ground in more than a dozen focus countries and with partners in over 50 nations. Menu About Us Mission & Values Experts & Staff Board of Directors Financials History Our Mission & Values WRI’s mission is to move human society to live in ways that protect Earth’s environment and its capacity to provide for the needs and aspirations of current and future generations. As a world-class research organization, we are driven by our values of impact, integrity, independence, partnership and care. Our Strategic Approach WRI applies a formula to achieve our bold vision. We call it “Count It. Change It. Scale It.”: Count It : Our work is guided by timely, independent research. WRI experts use cutting-edge methods to collect and analyze data, pinpoint problems, assess potential solutions and evaluate real-world outcomes. Our research is subject to rigorous peer reviews to ensure it is both credible and actionable. Change It : We then use our research to inform action on the ground. We start locally, partnering with communities, companies and government agencies to pilot innovative solutions with widespread potential. We help clear barriers to implementation and then monitor progress to learn what works — and what doesn’t. Scale It : Once tested, we strive to expand our successes nationally, regionally and globally. We work with stakeholders ranging from community members to national governments to adapt leading approaches to their needs and mobilize resources. And we make our learnings accessible through partnerships, publications and tools so others can follow suit. Our History WRI was founded by Gus Speth in 1982 in Washington, D.C. with a founding grant of $15 million from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Over time, WRI evolved into a global organization focused on turning research into results. The organization now boasts more than 2,000 staff around the world. Learn more about our history of results over the last 40+ years. Our Advantage WRI brings more than four decades of experience turning evidence into action. Our researchers are trusted experts in their fields. And our commitment to locally led action helps cultivate change that is not only beneficial, but lasting. Our unique approach is built on: World-class research : Timely, independent analysis is WRI’s cornerstone. All our research is peer reviewed and guided by a strategic plan for achieving positive impact. This ensures we assess every potential solution — and choose the right ones for the right places. For example, the State of Climate Action report we publish with partners is the world’s most comprehensive roadmap to close the emissions gap and hold temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Impact-driven data : WRI is at the forefront of using data, technology and AI to drive change. Our Global Forest Watch platform , launched in 2014, was the first open-access portal to track deforestation in near-real time using satellite data. It’s allowed governments, Indigenous groups and others halt illegal deforesters in their tracks. As technology trends shift, we will redouble our use of AI and digital products to accelerate research and enable timely action. Implementation support : We work with stakeholders at all levels to understand and overcome local implementation challenges. Together, we develop tailored solutions that benefit people, nature and the climate simultaneously. In Africa, our Restore Local initiative is providing funding and technical assistance to thousands of landscape restoration projects that will improve livelihoods, boost biodiversity, build climate resilience and reduce emissions. Mighty partnerships : WRI’s independent initiatives bring together governments, businesses, NGOs, civil society and more, forging lasting relationships that can help elevate solutions and raise global ambition. As secretariat of the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy , WRI helped secure commitments from 19 heads of state to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters, collectively covering half the world’s coastlines. Empowering others : We offer individuals, organizations and communities the resources and training needed to scale their impact. Our Partnering for Green Growth (P4G) initiative helps early-stage climate businesses become investment-ready — while also working with national governments and the private sector to develop a stronger market for climate innovation. We measure success by demonstrable change in the world, aligned with international accords like the Paris Agreement and UN Sustainable Development Goals. And we ensure all projects are guided by clear theories of change, designed to be equitable and inclusive, and include methods for tracking progress and learning from results — the key ingredients for maximum impact. A Commitment to Diversity To achieve our global goals, WRI brings together a workforce from diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. As the challenges of racial injustice, inequity, poverty, ecosystem degradation and climate change are inseparable, so, too, are the solutions. We recognize that diversity in all its forms is pivotal to our success. We aspire to foster an atmosphere where everyone feels welcomed and supported. Learn more about our DEI work . Join Us!
